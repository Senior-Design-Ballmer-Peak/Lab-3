    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hey there, I'm Tristan, a student at the University of Iowa, majoring in computer science and engineering. My focus during my time here has been on delving into the world of embedded systems. It's an area that has captivated my interest, blending hardware and software intricacies to create efficient systems that power various technologies we use daily.
      In my free time, I love immersing myself in a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and excited. Among these, you'll often find me tinkering away with my 3D printer, turning ideas into tangible creations. I also cherish the serene moments spent hiking, where nature's beauty never fails to captivate me. And when winter arrives, I eagerly embrace the thrill of Nordic skiing, relishing the crisp air and the exhilaration of gliding through snow-covered landscapes.
