    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <%= image_tag 'milesImages/img_4.png', alt: 'Miles in Seattle', class: 'feature-image small-image' %>
    <p> Greetings, I am Miles Cook Menster, a dedicated and driven 21-year-old senior at the University of Iowa,
      pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on computer systems.
      Hailing from the small town of Bloomfield, Iowa, I am poised to graduate in May 2024, equipped with a passion
      for leveraging electrical and computer engineering to make a positive impact on society. </p>

    <h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>
    <%= image_tag 'milesImages/img_3.png', alt: '"The Moth" project for embedded systems', class: 'feature-image small-image' %>
    <p> My academic journey has been centered around the convergence of electrical engineering and computer science.
      I am enthusiastic about delving into the intricacies of these fields, driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully to
      technological advancements. As a graduating senior, I aspire to channel my expertise towards enhancing sustainability
      and minimizing our environmental footprint. In the accompanied image, you can see my final project for embedded systems. It
      was a mobile system called "The Moth" which used photo resistors to seek out the brightest point in a room. It would then utilize an embedded C
      program to move towards the highest concentration of light. It also utilized an ultrasonic sensor and dual servo motors to move. One of the coolest
      projects I have had to opportunity to work on -- especially fulfilling to see the final result.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <%= image_tag 'milesImages/img_5.png', alt: 'Miles in front of Arconic factory', class: 'feature-image small-image' %>
    <p> As an Electrical Engineering Intern at Arconic, I collaborated with a diverse team to troubleshoot production lines
      and contribute to projects, gaining hands-on experience in advanced skills like 5000-level PLC programming and HMI configuration.
      This internship provided a deep understanding of the industry and emphasized effective teamwork. My Summer Member role at
      Green Iowa AmeriCorps further honed my collaborative skills in community-focused initiatives. Additionally, working as a
      summer custodian at the University of Iowa enhanced my adaptability and interpersonal skills within a diverse work environment.
      These experiences collectively strengthened my technical prowess while emphasizing the significance of teamwork, community engagement,
      and adaptability in professional settings. </p>

    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <%= image_tag 'milesImages/img_2.png', alt: 'Miles with brothers, wife, and dogs', class: 'feature-image small-image' %>
    <p> Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am deeply rooted in family values. I recently celebrated my
      marriage in October and cherish the time spent with my two brothers, wife, and dogs. My interests extend beyond the
      realm of technology, as I find joy in travel, gaming, anime, outdoor activities, and maintaining an active lifestyle.

    <p> In summary, I am an aspiring electrical engineer with a robust academic background, a passion for sustainability,
      and a commitment to personal and professional growth. I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic
      work environment and am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions to any team. </p>
