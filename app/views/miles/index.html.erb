    <h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>
    <!--    #<%#= image_tag 'charliesImages/bannerPhoto.jpeg', alt: 'Charlie in the Downtown Banner Campaign', class: 'feature-image small-image' %>-->
    <p> My academic journey has been centered around the convergence of electrical engineering and computer science.
      I am enthusiastic about delving into the intricacies of these fields, driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully to
      technological advancements. As a graduating senior, I aspire to channel my expertise towards enhancing sustainability
      and minimizing our environmental footprint. In the accompanied image, you can see my final project for embedded systems. It
    was a mobile system called "The Moth" which used photo resistors to seek out the brightest point. It would then utilize an embedded C
    program to move towards the brightest spot. It also utilized an ultrasonic sensor and dual servo motors to move. One of the coolest
    projects I have had to opportunity to work on -- especially fulfilling to see the final result.</p>
